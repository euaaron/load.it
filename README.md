# load.it: Reusable HTML/CSS/JS Loading Animations
Aaron's website repository for loading pages.

It started as an idea to make website with a loading screen, but I didn't made nothing than the loading screen... 

Now that I have another repo were I did start to make a website, I gonna use the this repo as an iframe to my website.

Later I pretend to make better loading animations and leave this repo just for them.

The full website using this initial animation can be found at euaaron.github.io or relbeits.net

That's all, folks.
